waterfall model:
details are marked clearly in an elaborated model in FRS it is a sequential manner process and that process is one by one steps.
once started user interacts with the requirement and designing phase later the user is involved in the testing phase 
advantages: The entire outlook of the project can be gathered at the start itself, and clear documentation in every phase, is most suited for well-defined projects

disadvantages: It is less flexible, client interaction is less, and late detection of error due to testing at the end

Agile model:
It is an interactive and iterative model client is involved from the start and in between the module completion and the requirements and the remarks are noted, adopted, and advanced in the communication and collaboration between the client and all teams
sprint - the period of time to complete the module 
advantages:
Adaptability
enhanced communication and collaboration
early continuous Delivery
improved transparency
disadvantages:
less documentation and design
Risk for never-ending project
need for expert
