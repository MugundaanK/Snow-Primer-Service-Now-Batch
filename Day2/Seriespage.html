    <h2>Episodes Description:</h2>
    <h2><u>Season 1</u>:</h2>
    <h3 id="ep1">Glorious Purpose:</h3>
    <p>Loki is arrested by the Time Variance Authority (TVA) when he creates a new timeline after escaping from the Battle of New York with the Tesseract in 2012.
        The TVA resets the timeline, and this "variant" Loki stands trial in front of Judge Ravonna Renslayer for crimes against the "Sacred Timeline". 
        Agent Mobius M. Mobius takes Loki to the Time Theater to review his past misdeeds and question his history of hurting people.
    </p>
    <h3 id="ep2">The Variants:</h3>
    <p>Loki joins a TVA mission to the site of an attack by "The Variant" in 1985 Oshkosh, Wisconsin, where he stalls and attempts to bargain his way into meeting the Time-Keepers, 
        who the TVA claims created them and the Sacred Timeline. Renslayer objects to Loki's further involvement, but Mobius convinces her to give him another chance. 
        Loki researches TVA files and theorizes that the Variant is hiding near apocalyptic events where their actions do not affect the timeline.

    <h2><u>Season 2</u>:</h2>
    <h3 id="ep3">Ouroborous:</h3>
    <p>In the past, the Time Variance Authority (TVA) attempts to apprehend Loki while he is uncontrollably warping across time in their headquarters. 
        In the present, Loki reunites with Mobius M. Mobius and warns him of the threat posed by the many variants of He Who Remains, the TVA's creator. 
        Concurrently, TVA General Dox has several TVA hunters arm themselves, ostensibly to find Sylvie,
    </p>
    <h3 id="ep4">Breaking Brat:</h3>
    <p>Loki, Mobius, and Hunter B-15 find and capture Hunter X-5 in London, 1977 on the Sacred Timeline, where he lives as film actor Brad Wolfe. 
        Under interrogation, he admits to abandoning Dox's mission and reveals Sylvie's location. Meanwhile, 
        Ouroboros attempts to repair the Loom to safely accommodate the branching timelines, but discovers he cannot access it without help from the missing Miss Minutes or He Who Remains's aura.
